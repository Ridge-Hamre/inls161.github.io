# INLS 161 Link from Marlee Hassell

## I found this website, which is similar to what we did on Github pages, but has nice *split-screen* and *live* aspects. The website is called [Markdown Live Preview](http://markdownlivepreview.com/).

Here are some things that you can look forward to in this link:
* live updates on the preview
* if you mess up, you can easily see why
* it comes automatically with examples of:
  1. headers,
  2. boldness,
  3. italics,
* And many more!


There are downsides to this website, however. The tab button does not work, but I found that three spaces will get the job ***done***.
